# Athletic DTW project Max Wenzel and Christoph Uhl

Our goal was to make an interface using micro-bits that would detect if you are sitting with good posture or not.

We used two micro-bits to collect accelerometer data.

In order to represent good posture we used a processing program that took in data from two different microbits and then found the difference between them as to represent them being unaligned and therefore when they're attached to upper and lower back they will represent how straight someone's back is.

We just used the out of the box dynamic timewarping algorithm with the default settings for our project as that is all that is provided through wekinator and we did not believe changing the values would help us reach our goal.\


The work we did could probably be improved upon by being combined with several other sensors that could measure other things such as brain activity or breathing so that they would provide other forms of feedback.
